## From Classroom to Cloud: My Journey to Secure Systems

I’m **Yogesh Shankar Gandal**, a governance-focused aspiring **DevSecOps Engineer** with a unique journey — from shaping future engineers as an academician, to building secure, scalable infrastructure in the real world.

After a decade of teaching as an **Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engineering**, I realized I wanted not just to explain systems — but to **build them**.  
That realization led me to pursue an **MBA in International Management** and earn a **PMP certification**, supporting IT operations at leading European financial organizations, driving digital transformation and agile delivery.

Today, I’m fully immersed in the world of **DevSecOps** — combining my structured academic thinking, management experience, and hands-on technical skills to deliver pipelines and infrastructure that are **not only fast, but auditable, secure, and future-proof**.

---

### 🔹 I work with tools and practices like:

- **Terraform** (enforcing tagging, logging, encryption by policy)
- **AWS-native security services** (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Config, Access Analyzer)
- **CI/CD pipelines with built-in security gates** (Trivy, OWASP Dependency Check, SonarQube)
- **Governance as Code** (OPA, Sentinel)

Every blog I write documents a **real challenge** I faced and solved — not just tutorials, but a growing library of **lived DevSecOps experience**.

## Why Governance Matters to Me

In a cloud-native world, **security isn't an afterthought — it's a first principle**.  
Good engineers don't just automate — they **automate responsibly**, with governance, auditability, and compliance built in.

That’s why I’m passionate about **Policy as Code**, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **Security Automation** — the pillars of truly sustainable DevSecOps.

## I Had, I Have, I Will

- **I had** the mindset to understand and explain complex engineering systems — first in Mechanical Engineering, then while mastering structured frameworks like PMP.  
  This ability to break down complexity shaped how I now design secure, reliable tech systems.

- **I have** a structured approach to work — planning tasks systematically through Jira, breaking down goals into achievable steps, and consistently following through.  
  Whether it's building infrastructure, pipelines, or governance patterns, my academic and project management background ensures clarity and discipline in execution.

- **I will** bring the same structured thinking, deep focus, and independent problem-solving to any team or project.  
  If given the opportunity, I will deliver **secure, scalable, and audit-ready solutions — reliably and professionally**.

I'm currently pursuing a **45-day DevSecOps Challenge**, where I **build, provision, or configure something every day** with governance understanding — not for certification, but for **real hands-on learning**.
