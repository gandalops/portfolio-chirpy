## My Story

**From Professor to Policy-Driven DevSecOps Engineer**

Just a year ago, I stood in a lecture hall, guiding engineering students through the fundamentals of systems and processes. I was an academic — structured, analytical, and deeply committed to clarity. But I had a realization: while I was shaping future engineers, **I was missing the thrill of building real systems myself.**

So I stepped down from the podium and into the terminal.

This journey isn’t just about learning DevOps — it’s about becoming the kind of engineer I once prepared others to be. And I chose a path that aligns with my values: **DevSecOps with a governance mindset.**

Why governance? Because in real-world infrastructure, it’s not enough to deploy. You must **deploy securely**, **audit continuously**, and **prove compliance automatically**. That’s the difference between a system that works — and a system you can trust.

## Why DevSecOps? Why Governance?

In a world where a small misconfiguration can lead to massive breaches, I decided early on that I wouldn’t just automate infrastructure — I would make it secure by design.

I now work with:
- **Terraform with strict policies, tagging, logging, encryption**
- **Jenkins pipelines with integrated security tools like Trivy and OWASP Dependency Check**
- **AWS-native tools like GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Config, and Access Analyzer**
- **Policy-as-Code tools like Sentinel and OPA**

Every blog I write is not a tutorial — it’s a **real problem I faced**, a solution I built, and a lesson I documented. It’s how I grow, and how I hope others can too.

## My Journey: I Had, I Have, I Will

- **I had** a decade of academic experience — structured thinking, clear articulation, and passion for mentoring.
- **I have** the hunger to learn, the curiosity to dive deep, and the discipline to show up daily.
- **I will** deliver pipelines that are not only fast — but also auditable, secure, and future-proof.

Right now, I’m in the middle of a **45-day DevSecOps challenge**. Every day, I build something new: a pipeline, a security control, a governance pattern. I’m not just chasing certifications — I’m chasing understanding.

And the result? A transformation that’s visible — in my repositories, in my blogs, and in the way I now think about DevSecOps.
